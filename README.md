# Cube-wars

A small game project to show of my skills in Unity.
Made in around 8 hours total.

## Gameplay

Player can move up and down, and shoot projectiles to incoming waves of enemies.

Player have 3 lives, and after losing all of them, the game ends.

By destroying enemy planes, the player gets set amount of points.

Game time is restricted and shown by timer on the bottom of the screen.

## Controls

On High-Score Screen any button starts the game.

In game use W/S to move up/down and SPACE to shoot.

## Highlights

I'm using object pool to reuse enemies and bullets.

Using singleton design pattern on Game Manger.

Using simple shader to scroll background.
